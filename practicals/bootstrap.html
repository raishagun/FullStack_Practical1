    <p>Bootstrap is a free and open-source framework for creating websites and web applications. It's the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.
        Bootstrap is promoted as being One framework, every device. This is because websites built with Bootstrap will automatically scale between devices â€” whether the device is a mobile phone, tablet, laptop, desktop computer, screen reader, etc.
